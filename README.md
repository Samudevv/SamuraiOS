# Ethernet should just work out of the box. If you have need a wifi connection this is how to do it
# Using wpa_supplicant to connect to the WiFi
rfkill unblock wifi
ip link set wlan0 up # Replace wlan0 with the interface name. List all with "ip link show"
wpa_passphrase 'SSID' > /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf # Replace SSID with the name of your WiFi and enter the passphrase
wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf # Replace wlan0 with your interface
dhcpcd wlan0 # Here again replace wlan0 with the name of your interface

# Using nmcli with NetworkManager
rkill unblock wifi # Maybe the wifi needs to be unblocked
nmcli dev status # To check the state of things
nmcli radio wifi # To check the sate of wifi
nmcli radio wifi on # Switch the wifi on
nmcli dev wifi list # Scan for nearby access points
nmcli --ask dev wifi connect <SSID> # Connect to the wifi (this needs admin privileges!)
```

## Fix Bluetooth

You may need to call `modprobe btusb` to make bluetooth work. And maybe even to set up a systemd service for that.

You need to install `bluez-utils-compat`

```
sudo hciconfig hci0 down
sudo rmmod btusb
sudo modprobe btusb
sudo hciconfig hci0 up
```
