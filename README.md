## Stage 0

1. Choose keyboard layout
```
loadkeys de
```

2. Partition the disk and create file system
```console
lsblk # Make sure to choose the correct drive
cfdisk /dev/sda # This is just an example!
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
mkswap /dev/sda2 # For swap if necessary
```

3. Mount partitions on `/mnt`
```console
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/boot # For boot partition on UEFI systems
```

4. Connect to the internet
```console
# Ethernet should just work out of the box. If you have need a wifi connection this is how to do it
# Using wpa_supplicant to connect to the WiFi
rfkill unblock wifi
ip link set wlan0 up # Replace wlan0 with the interface name. List all with "ip link show"
wpa_passphrase 'SSID' > /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf # Replace SSID with the name of your WiFi and enter the passphrase
wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf # Replace wlan0 with your interface
dhcpcd wlan0 # Here again replace wlan0 with the name of your interface

# Using nmcli with NetworkManager
rkill unblock wifi # Maybe the wifi needs to be unblocked
nmcli dev status # To check the state of things
nmcli radio wifi # To check the sate of wifi
nmcli radio wifi on # Switch the wifi on
nmcli dev wifi list # Scan for nearby access points
nmcli --ask dev wifi connect <SSID> # Connect to the wifi (this needs admin privileges!)
```

5. Download `install0.sh` script and execute it
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Samudevv/SamuraiOS/master/scripts/install0.sh | bash -s # You can add -y|--yes to use all default arguments and -u|--user to just change the user name and password
```

6.  Reboot into the new drive
```
reboot
```

## Setup after reboot

## Fix Bluetooth

You may need to call `modprobe btusb` to make bluetooth work. And maybe even to set up a systemd service for that.

You need to install `bluez-utils-compat`

```
sudo hciconfig hci0 down
sudo rmmod btusb
sudo modprobe btusb
sudo hciconfig hci0 up
```
